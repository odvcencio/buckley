## Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep Buckley and its users safe. We prioritize responsible disclosure and will work with you to address issues quickly.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please email security@buckley.dev with a detailed report. Include reproduction steps, affected versions/commit SHAs, and any known impact.
- If emailing is not possible, open a private security advisory via GitHub Security Advisories once the repository is public.
- Do **not** file a public issue for security problems.

### What Happens Next

1. We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
2. We will investigate, coordinate a fix, and credit reporters who want to be acknowledged.
3. We will publish a security release and disclosure after a fix is available or a mitigation exists.

### Scope

- The Buckley CLI, IPC/ACP servers, and bundled plugins.
- Helm charts, Docker images, and default container assets.

### Out of Scope

- Third-party plugins not maintained by the Buckley team.
- Issues that require privileged local access beyond default configuration.
