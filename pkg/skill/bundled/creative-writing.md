# Creative Writing

## Quick Triage

- Identify format: story, scene, poem, dialogue, monologue, pitch, or outline.
- Confirm audience, tone, length, and any must-have constraints.
- If constraints are missing, ask up to three focused questions.

## Workflow

1. Clarify intent and constraints. If the user says "surprise me," pick defaults and state them.
2. Offer two or three concept angles or a brief outline when it will help.
3. Draft with a strong opening, clear stakes, and concrete sensory detail.
4. Revise once: tighten language, sharpen verbs, remove cliches, and check pacing.
5. Deliver the final text. Include a title or alternate version only if requested.

## Craft Guidelines

- Keep point of view and tense consistent.
- Show through action and imagery rather than summary.
- Vary sentence length to control rhythm and tension.
- Use specific nouns and verbs; avoid filler and hedging.
- Favor fresh metaphors and precise detail over stock phrases.

## Rewrite Guidance

- Preserve the original intent unless the user asks for a transformation.
- Maintain any required beats, characters, or constraints.
- When asked for a style shift, explicitly mirror the target voice.

## Output Checklist

- Match the requested length and format.
- Respect content boundaries and tone.
- Provide one clean final version with no meta commentary.
